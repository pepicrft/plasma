[Plasma](https://github.com/pepicrft/Plasma) is a local-first tool for building iOS and Android apps with AI agents. It bridges coding agents like [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and [Cursor](https://cursor.com) with mobile build toolchains and runtime capabilities, enabling a new kind of development experience where chat is central and agents do the heavy lifting.
